This is neekothing by Russian developer kotowasiy. It is an obscure experimental game based on OpenSS13 code, but otherwise being totally different to SS13.

In kotowasiy's words:

The neekothing is a quazitrash byond game coded from the ground up which is about space occultists, "demons" who call themselves gods (i.e. almost all of the gods), drugs and communists. It is more killy and more funky than SS13 and have loads of occultism and drugs (especially drugs). It shares the same universe with Lifeweb (you probably heard about it). It is somewhat ugly, filled with bad english, does not work on a regular basis and very ACIDIC to the eye, but very (and surprisingly!) interesting and full of features, so many people find it very good. However, if you just join it, odds are high what you will understand nothing, so I will help you with manuals, answer to your questions (just contact kotowasiy via chat or PM in discord) and will say you via discord if it is up.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SS13/comments/5ir205/neekothing_game_guides/ - there're really LOTS of fluff and manuals pinned to this thread. They will be useful not only for professions, but just for everybody. For example, neekothing_basics are useful for anybody who want to stay alive for 5 minutes. Engineering manuals contains guides of (de)construction stuff and may be useful for cognitologists (drugged consciousness researchers) for setting their mini-engine. If you don't like discord, I can create subreddit, but I'm afraid what it will be empty 24/7 and, as a result, absolutely useless. Anyway, try neekothing. It is not as much experience as snorting large track of 2C-B, but very deep, interesting and (somewhat) weird.

ALso, I'm in a very bad live conditions so I am always beggaring.
